This program uses FSA + Driver as described in proj1 description.
Program is commented in each file for better description.

Please note: 
1. This program allows for an endless comment block:
As in you can start a comment and never finish it.
The program will run fine assuming you did not intend to end your comment block.

2. This program will continue to run after encountering a syntax error.
This is for the benefit of the user to find errors beyond the initial one.
